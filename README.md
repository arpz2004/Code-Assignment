# Double Agents

### Compilation Instructions
1) Download zip file from email or from GitHub: https://github.com/arpz2004/Code-Assignment
Extract all of the files then navigate to the directory containing the source code. (Go inside
the directory DoubleAgent where the file "grailsw" is located).

2) Run the command ```./grailsw run-app```. If no errors, move on to step 3. If you 
get an error saying JAVA_HOME is not set, then install JDK and set JAVA_HOME by 
following the instructions [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml) then 
run the command again (must be in a new terminal after setting JAVA_HOME).

3) Wait until the previous command downloads everything. It is finished when it says
"Grails application running at http://localhost:8080".

4) Open browser and enter ```localhost:8080``` after the server starts.
